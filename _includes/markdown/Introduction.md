The 10up Engineering Best Practices are not geared to teach anyone to become designers or PHP/JavaScript engineers. Rather it aims to show how to design and program in PHP and JavaScript the 10up way. Therefore this is intended for web and design engineers.

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>

As a company we strive to efficiently provide websites and components that lend a top-notch user experience. In order to improve efficiency we need to standardize what we use and how we use it. This includes tools, frameworks, libraries, style, version control, and even languages. Standardizing these things will allow us to understand better the inner-workings of someone elseâ€™s project and produce better solutions ourselves. As such 10up engineers should follow these best practices in all their work. Our best practices are not meant to be restricting or comprehensive. We value creativity at 10up. The aim is for this document to provide a strong guidance not an authoritative direction. It's our hope that these best practices will not only influence 10up'ers but community members as well.

> "We make web publishing easy. Maybe even fun."

At the very heart of 10up is the publishing or user experience. WordPress, we firmly believe, is the best tool for this. We sell custom publishing experiences to major companies and brands around the world. These publishing experiences or websites are tailor made for our clients and their specific needs. As such the content management experience cannot be genericized. We don't cut corners when it comes to user experience and interface. We don't take shortcuts that compromise the end experience for the user. We don't distribute pre-packaged, auto-generated user interfaces or components.

> "Keep it simple."

While our solutions are far from simple, we want our code, tools, processes, systems, and practices to be as simple as possible. Simplicity facilitates collaboration as there is a lower barrier of entry. This goes for things like PHP code design patterns as well as workflow. We discourage practices such as writing extra levels of code abstraction (wrapping existing API's) as they complicate debugging and add another component that needs to be maintained.

This is a living, breathing document. At 10up we value open source because we believe it yields the best solutions for everyone. We don't know everything and value the knowledge of the collective community. Please contribute via [pull requests on Github](https://github.com/10up/Engineering-Best-Practices).
