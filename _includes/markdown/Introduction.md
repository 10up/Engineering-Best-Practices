The 10up Engineering Best Practices are not geared to teach anyone to become an engineer. Rather, they aim to illustrate how to engineer the 10up way. Therefore, these best practices are intended for capable engineers.

<h2 id="goal" class="anchor-heading">Goal {% include Util/top %}</h2>

As a company, we strive to provide websites and components that yield a top-notch user experience. In order to improve efficiency, we need to standardize what we use and how we use it. Standardizing our tools, frameworks, libraries, style, version control, and even languages will allow us to better understand the inner workings of someone elseâ€™s project and produce better solutions ourselves.

As such, 10up engineers should follow these best practices in all their work. Our best practices are not meant to be restrictive or comprehensive; we value creativity at 10up. The aim is for this document to provide a strong guidance, not an authoritative direction. It's our hope that these best practices will not only influence 10uppers but community members as well.

> "We make web publishing easy. Maybe even fun."

At the very heart of 10up is the publishing or user experience. WordPress, we firmly believe, is the best starting point to achieve this. We design and build custom publishing experiences for major companies and brands around the world. Our publishing experiences or websites are tailor-made for our clients and their specific needs.

As such, the content management experience cannot be made to be generic. We don't cut corners when it comes to user experience and interface. We don't take shortcuts that compromise the end experience for the user. We don't distribute pre-packaged, auto-generated user interfaces or components.

> "Keep it simple."

While our solutions are complex, we want our code, tools, processes, systems, and practices to be as simple as possible. Simplicity facilitates collaboration as there is a lower barrier of entry. This goes for things like PHP design patterns as well as workflow. We discourage practices such as writing extra levels of code abstraction (wrapping existing API's) as they complicate debugging and add another component that needs to be maintained.

> "We are always learning."

We are constantly challenging ourselves and learning. Knowledge gives us a competitive edge. Everyone around us is growing; if we stop growing individually or collectively and stop challenging ourselves to improve, we fall behind. For that reason, this document is not set in stone and will change. Evolving these best practices through contributions is incredibly important to us.
