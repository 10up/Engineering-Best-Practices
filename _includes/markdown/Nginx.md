[Nginx](http://nginx.org/ "Nginx Web Server") is our preferred web server software at 10up. It has proven extremely stable, performant, and reliable at high scale and offers a powerful set of tools. This is not to imply there is anything wrong with using [Apache])(https://httpd.apache.org/ "Apache Web Server") - weâ€™ve worked on many high scale deployments that use Apache and mod_php that perform very well.  10up maintains a public set of [Nginx configuration templates](https://github.com/10up/nginx_configs "10up Nginx Configuration Template for WordPress") that apply these best practices.
