Nginx is our preferred web server software at 10up. It has proven extremely stable, performant, and reliable at high scale and offers a powerful set of tools. This is not to imply there is anything wrong with using Apache - weâ€™ve worked on many high scale deployments that use Apache and mod_php that perform very well.  10up maintains a public set of Nginx configuration templates that apply these best practices.
