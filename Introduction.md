# Audience

The 10up Engineering Best Practices are not geared to teach anyone to become designers or PHP/JavaScript engineers. Rather it aims to show how to design and program in PHP and JavaScript the 10up way. Therefore this is intended for web and design engineers.

# Goal

As a company we strive to efficiently provide websites and components that lend a top-notch user experience. In order to improve efficiency we need to standardize what we use and how we use it. This includes tools, frameworks, libraries, style, version control, and even languages. Standardizing these things will allow us to understand better the inner-workings of someone elseâ€™s project and produce better solutions ourselves.

# Philosophy

> "We make web publishing easy. Maybe even fun"

At the very heart of 10up is the publishing or user experience. WordPress, we firmly believe, is the best tool for this. We sell custom publishing experiences to major companies and brands around the world. These publishing experiences or websites are tailor made for our clients and their specific needs. As such the content management experience cannot be genericized. We don't cut corners when it comes to user experience and interface. We don't take shortcuts that compromise the end experience for the user. We don't distribute pre-packaged, auto-generated user interfaces or components.
